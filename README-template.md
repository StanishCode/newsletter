## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

Need to further develop responsive layout designs to help minimize the amount of needed media queries. Still learning how to best use min and max dimensions with flexbox and grid so less media are required to obtain a responsive application.

I found using a CSS architecture like BEM to be useful in dividing the CSS code and isolating issues throughtout the challenge.
